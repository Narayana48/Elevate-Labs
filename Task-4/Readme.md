# Task 4

## Java File I/O â€“ Notes App

### This Notes App is implemented in a single Java file:

## [Working.java](https://github.com/Narayana48/Elevate-Labs/blob/main/Task-4/Working.java)

### In this Java file, I have created two methods: [addNotes](https://github.com/Narayana48/Elevate-Labs/blob/main/Task-4/Working.java#L7) and [viewNotes](https://github.com/Narayana48/Elevate-Labs/blob/main/Task-4/Working.java#L27).

### The addNotes method allows users to add new notes to the file.

### The viewNotes method displays the existing notes from the file.

### At the beginning of the code, a new file named demo.txt is created (if it does not already exist).
### All note entries are written to and read from this file.
